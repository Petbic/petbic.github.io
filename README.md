## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Card.astro
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |

## Deploy

### Prerequisites

* [Install firebase cli](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#install_the_firebase_cli)

### Deploy to prod environment

The deployment to prod will be done in a github action pipeline, but if you want to deploy it manually you can execute the next command

```
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

After execute the files in the static folder will be pushed to the firebase hosting and are available in the hosting url (you will get a reminder of that url after execute the previous command)

### Deploy a prerelase

To deploy a temporally preview of the webpage you must execute the following command:

```
firebase hosting:channel:deploy [name of the preview]
```

After execute it firebase will provide the previo url and the expiration time

> You can define the expiration time using the `-e` parameter: ex. `firebase hosting:channel:deploy [name of the preview] -e 10m`
